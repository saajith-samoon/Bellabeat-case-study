# Bellabeat-case-study

This case study is done for my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project. 

My task - I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

We will be answering these 3 main questions through our analysis.

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?**
